# PGSleepy_PrimalFire
This addon was mainly made because I kept forgetting the run amounts for rotating positions.
Ended up making the whole process automated, from the Ready Check to listening for events if everyone is ready.

`/primal_start` is the command to initiate the program.

It will initiate a ready check and listen if everyone is ready. 
When everyone is ready, it'll display a Ready text within the Party and use the command `/countdown 105` for the 1.45 minutes of farming.

It is extremely simple, made within 15 minutes even though I don't know LUA. lol
